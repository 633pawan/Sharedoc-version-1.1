make changes in to the config.php file where you provide your database connectivity information.
have to create two database connections:
1# for the user name password registration where by you can get the confirmation code in the database and use it to confirm the code 
in the system and use username and password
2# this second database connectivity  saves the uploaded file's info into the database.
 For user table you dont need a .sql file to create table as auto table is created as you go along.
